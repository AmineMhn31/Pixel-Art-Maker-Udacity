# Pixel-Art-Maker-Udacity
You create a one-page web application that lets users draw a pixel image on a customizable panel.  
To begin, you'll be given starter code (including HTML and CSS) to build the application. You'll write JavaScript code that lets the user create a grid of squares representing their design, and apply colors to those squares to create a digital masterpiece!
